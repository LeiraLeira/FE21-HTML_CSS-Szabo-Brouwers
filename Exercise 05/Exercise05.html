        <div class="summary">A cleaning fan on TikTok was left feeling sick after discovering that the flooring in her new house wasn't actually meant to be dark - it was actually just very dirty</div>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Moving into a new home and getting everything clean and just the way you like it can be so satisfying. But after getting settled in her new pad, one woman was horrified to discover it wasn't quite as tidy as she thought. A TikTok user named @dandycleans has gone viral after sharing the realisation she had about the flooring. She uploaded a clip on to the social media platform showing her scrubbing a section of her floor and as she wipes, it becomes lighter and lighter. The video was captioned: "When I moved in I just thought the floor was dark."  
            </p>  
            <p>Alongside this she added two vomiting emojis, to really emphasise how she was feeling about the whole thing.</p>
